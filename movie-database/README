Building the Movie Database project was a great learning experience. 
I gained hands-on experience with API integration, React hooks for state management, and Tailwind CSS for responsive design. 
One challenge I faced was handling API errors and ensuring the UI was responsive across devices, but overcoming these obstacles taught me valuable problem-solving skills. 
Overall, the project helped me improve my frontend development skills and gave me a solid foundation for building more complex applications in the future. 
I'm proud of the result and excited to expand on it.
