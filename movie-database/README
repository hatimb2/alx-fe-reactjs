# Movie Database App

## Overview

This is a simple movie database application built with React. It allows users to search for movies, view details about them, and explore a wide variety of movies through a user-friendly interface. The app integrates with the OMDB API to fetch movie data.

## Features

- **Movie Search**: Users can search for movies by name using the search bar.
- **Movie List**: Displays a list of movie cards that match the search query.
- **Movie Details**: Users can click on a movie to see more detailed information, such as the plot, actors, and release year.
- **Loading Indicator**: Displays a loading message while fetching movie data.
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages in case of invalid API calls or empty search results.

## Components

### 1. **App**
The main component that holds the state and logic for searching and displaying movies, as well as selecting a movie for detailed view.

- **State**: 
  - `searchQuery`: The query entered by the user in the search bar.
  - `movies`: An array of movies returned from the OMDB API based on the search query.
  - `selectedMovie`: A movie object containing detailed information about the selected movie.
  - `loading`: A boolean that determines if data is currently being fetched.
  - `error`: Holds any error message returned during the fetch operation.

### 2. **SearchBar**
A functional component that takes input from the user for the movie search. It triggers the `setSearchQuery` function when the input changes.

### 3. **MovieCard**
Displays individual movie cards with basic details (like title, year, poster) for each movie in the search results. Clicking a card fetches and displays detailed movie information.

### 4. **MovieDetails**
Displays detailed information about the selected movie, such as the plot, actors, and release date. It includes a close button to hide the detailed view.

## API Integration

The app uses the OMDB API for fetching movie data. The API key is loaded from an environment variable (`VITE_OMDB_API_KEY`). Make sure to configure your OMDB API key in the environment settings.
